date: 11-11-2013

**Weekly Record**

Books finished this week: Two, *The Skies Belong To Us* and *Rework*

Books started: One, *Cryptonomicon*. I must get it done for book club, but it's sooo long. So I'm not letting myself read ANYTHING ELSE until I get it done. (I may break this promise.)

Movies watched: A surprising two, Clue and Love Actually. (No, nothing new.)

Rock climbing trips: One

Seahawks games attended: ONE! (#gohawks)

Miles walked: **at least 24**. Yeah, I'd be impressed but most of it is literally walking to/from school.

Words written in my novel: ZERO. Dammit.

TV shows watched: Zero. I'm behind in everything. No spoilers!

**An Explanation**

Look, I'm not good at blogging about myself, and I'd rather be reading right now than staring at a blank page, trying to figure it out. So let me just cut to the chase and say; there's a lot of stuff I want to be doing that I'm not and I think if I start tracking it, I'll magically find time to do them. (The magic in this case means, spending less time aimlessly reading dumb blogs, scanning Facebook, or reloading what-would-i-say.com to generate (admittedly hilarious) Facebook statuses for myself.)

I'm amazed at the amount of stuff that's in my brain that wasn't three weeks ago. People ask me if I feel like I'm actually learning anything, and I never feel like I can express HOW MUCH. Three and a half weeks ago I was making ice cream. Three weeks ago I was learning about strings. Two weeks ago I build a program that randomly generated a solar system. (A text one. Not as beautiful and romantic as it sounds in some ways, but more than it sounds for me.) This past week, I was manipulating csv files like a boss. (Well, like a slow boss.) I dream in code, now. Yes, I'm learning things, more than I have in years, and every day my brain shows up, happy and eager to absorb more. Sure, sometimes we move too quickly and I have to go home and look over my notes and do practice problems, and no, I haven't achieved any kind of expertise of real fluency in what we're doing, but there's a real pride in looking at someone else's code and thinking, "I see what's going on. This is a thing that I can track," rather than "OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT."
